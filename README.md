# Webscraping for a Box Office Predictor

This project was made as part of my work at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in the summer of 2017.  I used BeautifulSoup to web scrape monetary data for movies (i.e. budget and box office gross) to create a predictor for the opening weekend domestic gross earnings.
